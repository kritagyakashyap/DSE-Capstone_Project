### Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features. By comparing various regression algorithms, the goal is to determine the best model for predicting car prices and add value to customers and businesses in the automotive sector.

## Project Objective

• Accurate Price Prediction: Develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on its features.
• Model Comparison: Compare different regression algorithms to select the most effective one.

## Key Area and Gaps Identified

• Improved Market Clarity: By providing accurate and reliable price estimates, the project helps reduce information asymmetry between buyers and sellers.

• Efficient Negotiations: More transparent pricing enables fairer and quicker negotiations, improving market efficiency.

• Time-Saving: A quick estimation tool saves time and effort for both buyers and sellers.

• Business Optimization: Car dealerships and rental companies can use insights from the model to adjust pricing strategies (e.g., value-based and dynamic pricing) based on market trends, customer behavior, and competition.

## Algorithms Used

•Regression Algorithms: Used for their ability to provide continuous value predictions, crucial for forecasting the actual price rather than just price ranges.

## Outcome

This project provides a framework for accurately predicting used car prices, helping customers make informed purchases and aiding businesses in optimizing their pricing strategies for increased profitability.
