## Topic Survey in brief
### WHAT WOULD WE ACHIEVE BY THIS PROJECT?

The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict
the price of a used car based on its features, to make informed purchases. We will compare
the performance of various machine learning algorithms and choose the best one out of them.
Depending on various parameters we will determine the price of the car. Regression
Algorithms are used because they provide us with continuous values as output and not
categorical values because of which it will be possible to predict the actual price of a car
rather than the price range of a car.

### THE KEY AREA AND GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE TOPIC SURVEY WHERE THE PROJECT CAN ADD VALUE TO THE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS:

• It will improve clarity in the used car market by providing more accurate and reliable
price estimates to buyers and sellers.

• It will reduce information imbalance between buyers and sellers, which can lead to
more efficient and fair negotiations.

• It will be saving time and effort for buyers and sellers by providing a quick and easy
way to estimate a car's value.

• It can help dealerships and car rental companies in the automotive industry to improve
their profits by suggesting ways to set prices effectively. This involves analyzing
market trends, customer behaviour and competition, and implementing strategies like
value-based pricing and dynamic pricing to stay competitive and maximize revenue.
Regularly monitoring and adjusting prices can also help improve profitability.
